### Use a programmable MacroPad to avoid being fired!

<img src="images/Fired.png" width="16" height="16"/> *US banking giant Wells Fargo has sacked a number of employees following claims that staff were faking keyboard activity to fool the company into thinking they were working at home when they were not.*
[**As reported here 14 June 2024.**](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjll01220yeo)

<img src="1million-macros.jpg" width="16" height="16"/> Use a [**TouchLCDMacropad with more than one million macros - which can be even further expanded through linked macro-lists**](https://github.com/TobiasVanDyk/Pico-MCU-from-Raspberry-Pi/tree/main/TouchMacroPadPico) - to simulate (almost) any type of PC-based work, and being a trusted hardware device, also bypass detection algorithms for software-based-automation-tools such as [**AutoIt**](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/) and [**Power-Automate**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/power-automate). A PC Windows-based configuration tool for the Pico Touch LCD is also available. Pressing keys on the PC app can press the same key on the TouchLCD, which then through USB HID, send the keypress back to the PC.
