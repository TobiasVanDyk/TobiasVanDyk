<img src="1million-macros.jpg" width="16" height="16"/> Use a [**TouchLCDMacropad with more than one million macros - which can be even further expanded through linked macro-lists**](https://github.com/TobiasVanDyk/Pico-MCU-from-Raspberry-Pi/tree/main/TouchMacroPadPico) - to simulate (almost) any type of PC-based work, and being a trusted hardware device, also bypass detection algorithms for software-based-automation-tools such as [**AutoIt**](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/) and [**Power-Automate**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/power-automate). A PC Windows-based configuration tool for the Pico Touch LCD is also available.
