Add to /boot/config.txt:

Only add this if the two lines below fails to overclock
#force_turbo=1

over_voltage=6
arm_freq=2000

Check the CPU frequency:

cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_cur_freq

Divide the result by 1000 to find the value in MHz.
Note: CPU/GPU core voltage adjustment. [-16,8] equates to [0.8V,1.4V] with 0.025V steps; in other words, specifying -16 will give 0.8V as the GPU/core voltage, and specifying 8 will give 1.4V. The default value is 0 (1.2V). 

Values above 6 are only allowed when force_turbo or current_limit_override are specified; this sets the warranty bit.
