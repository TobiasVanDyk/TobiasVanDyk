**Raspberry Pi 400:** To accommodate three other Raspberry Pi computers such as the Pi 400, whilst using only one 500GB SSD in an M.2 external enclosure, I partitioned the 500GB SSD into four partitions - three 50GB primary partitions for the Raspberry Pi root file system, and the rest as a 350GB FAT32 partition which holds video and  audio files, binaries and various Raspberry Pi related documents. Doing it this way enables me to plug the SSD into another computer and then synchronize it with my music and video collection and Raspberry Pi documentation, from the other computer. <img src="images/RealUnixersDoNotUseBootSDCards.png" width="16" height="16"/> For all three Raspberry Pi computers I [still](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=28&t=301409) use an SDCard as the boot partition, and they respectively boot /dev/sda1, /dev/sda2, and /dev/sda3. The three different Pi computers are a RPi 4B with an audio DAC (left picture below, and also see the last section [**here**](https://github.com/TobiasVanDyk/Raspberry-Pi-PC-PSU-Desktop-Computer-with-a-Hard-Disk-Drive-and-Fan-and-Switch)), a Raspberry Pi 400 (middle and right picture below), and another RPi used to test SPI LCD hats and programming the Pico. 

I can then plug the drive into a windows PC and 
1. Use Macrium Reflect Free to make backups of the ext4 partitions 1 to 3. It is one of the few free Windows imaging programs that support ext4 partitions.
2. Use the Windows Western Digital SSD Dashboard to run TRIM on the SSD
3. Use a synch program to update the data partition from the other PC.
